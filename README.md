# Advent-of-Code-2020
This repository acts as an end of 2020 benchmark.

Completed Challenges: 7.5/25 (it's a starting point!)

Files with "Rewrite" in title are rewrites of my initial solution to a prompt with a focus on leveraging a python tool that leads to a more novel or efficient solution :)

Excited to see what the new year brings and seeing if I can get the fabled 10/25 for AoC 2021~ Merry almost new year to any readers!
